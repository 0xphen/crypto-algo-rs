Repository with Rust 🦀 implementations of select cryptographic algorithms to reinforce my understanding.

## List of cryptography algorithms
This list contains cryptographic primitives and mathematical structures that I want to implement.

List of symbols:
- :heavy_check_mark: means the algorithm is implemented.
- 🏗️ means that the algorithm is partially implemented or is under active construction.
- :x: means that the algorithm is not currently implemented.

| Algorithm  | Supported        |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Diffie-Hellman | :heavy_check_mark: |
| SHA-256    | 🏗️           |
| Miller-Rabin primality test | :heavy_check_mark: |
| RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) | :x:          |
| AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) | :x:           |
| Elliptic Curve Cryptography | :x:          |
| HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) | :x:          |
| RSA | :x:          |
