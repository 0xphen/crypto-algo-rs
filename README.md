This repository contains Rust 🦀 implementations of certain cryptographic algorithms, serving to strengthen my understanding of them.

## List of cryptography algorithms
This list contains cryptographic primitives and mathematical structures that I want to implement.

List of symbols:
- :heavy_check_mark: means the algorithm is implemented.
- 🏗️ means that the algorithm is partially implemented or is under active construction.
- :x: means that the algorithm is not currently implemented.
